Plug this into a signal socket to set the signal to a constant value. The higher the signal, the brighter green it is coloured.

Open the configuration dialog to more accurately control the Jumper's value, down to increments of 0.00001.

To transmit a jumper value over a wireless channel, you can wire up a [[Mini transmitter]] to a [[Signal clip]].
