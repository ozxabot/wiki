**NOTE: This is a beta object, please be careful when using it as it can have unintended behaviour.**

Used to repair or reconfigure robots with different components.

Objects can be dragged to the antenna using the builder tool.

## Adventure Usage
Choose an item you want to replace or equip. Lets say you want to equip a [[Circuit of Regeneration]] and replace the robot head with a [[Cow head]]. Simply use the builder tool to drag the items to the blue antenna.

If you want to replace robot parts of another robot, climb the ladder while the the non-player robot is in front of the repair station, then activate the monitor on top the repair station. The same window will appear.
