An electronic device that outputs a sawtooth signal. A sawtooth signal ramps up from 0 to 1 and then abruptly drops to 0 and repeats again, creating a pattern similar to teeth on a saw.

## Properties:
- **Frequency Hz**: Determines how fast the signal oscillates.
- **Phase**: Determines where in oscillation motion it begins.

## Socket information
- **`OUT0`**: Outputs the current value of the oscillation
