Light, hollow robot that can step on [[Command pad]] objects to receive commands. For puzzle levels, the level is completed if any robot steps on a [[Goal]]. Can be played in Adventure levels.

It can be configured and customised to give it a different body, head and many different weapons. In the procedurally generated adventure world, enemy robots spawn with random items and weapons that they may drop when killed. In-game, a robot can be customised using the [[Repair Station]] if you feed the station new parts.

- **Default Weapon:** Arm gun that shoots bullets.
- **Special Ability:** Becoming a box that mitigates damage.
