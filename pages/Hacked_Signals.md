Hacked Signals refer to any signal value outside the regular 0.0 to 1.0 boundary. They can be obtained through a number of means, from exploiting a glitch with the [[Linear Decay]] object to hex editing the value of a [[Jumper]].

Most objects behave in strange and undefined ways when receiving a hacked signal as an input. Depending on the signaling object, it may be able to propagate another hacked signal in an output socket, or it outputs a clamped value within the regular 0.0-1.0 range.
