Cable clip for signal cables (red cables). The cable clip allows you to drag signal cables along other objects. The signal is passed through the clip without modification.

Outside of improving cable management, it's also useful for transmitting a constant [[Jumper]] signal to a [[Mini transmitter]], or connecting together contraptions for exporting through Multi-select or absorbing using the [[Auto Absorber]]
