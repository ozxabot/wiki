Blue cable used for communication between motors and controllers (CT family).

The purpose of interface system is to allow you to keep your advanced circuitry at one location. By communicating with CT objects instead of with motors directly, only one cable (the interface cable) per motor needs to reach outside your system. This keeps your advanced electronics safe in one location and avoids cable clutter.

To read more about how to use the interface cable, see the [[CT Mini]].
