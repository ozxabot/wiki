Forward **`IN0`** to **`OUT0`** and represent the value from **`IN0`** on the display in graph form with a brief history of the previous signal values.

The Grapher is very useful for studying and debugging the output of other signaling objects. If you want to see the exact value (down to two decimals), then enable the "Display grapher value" setting in the interface settings tab.

## Socket information
- **`IN0`**: Input
- **`OUT0`**: Unchanged value of **`IN0`**
