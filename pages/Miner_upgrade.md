{{ infobox_item({

}) }}

Item with the model of an Oil upgrade item, but tinted blue. Can be absorbed by the robot by putting it close with the builder, but does nothing.

It is assumed to have acted as an upgrade for the Miner item (now known as the [[Zapper]]), but was never actually implemented and remains in the game as an useless item.
